# Hangman

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Description

The code takes single alphabetical input from the player to and then checks its existence in a ranzomized word from a predetermined list. The output will inform the player of how close they are to completing the word with every iteration and will inform the player if the input is wrong and if they ran out of lives.

Through implementation of this project I got a more in-depth understanding of how to view code more holistically and how it can be optimized for both ease of reading and functioning.

# Installation and Usage

The game is found in the milestone_5.py file. Running the file with automatically start the game with a predetermined list of words.

# File structure of the project

The game is composed of the Hangman class containing the attributes and input checking methods and a play_game()function that dictates what outcomes the player receives.
